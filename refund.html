                <p class="easy-small">
                    We will generally not process refunds for payments made through the
                    payment gateway. However,
                    exceptions exist in the following situations:
                </p>
                <div class="easy-small">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Technical Error:</strong> Multiple debits from your
                        card/bank account or excess debit in a single transaction due
                        to a technical error. In such cases, the excess amount
                        <strong>excluding payment gateway charges</strong> will be
                        refunded.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Unsuccessful Enrollment:</strong> Payment charged but
                        enrollment for a service is unsuccessful due to a technical
                        error. We will prioritize resolving the enrollment issue at no
                        additional cost.
                        However, if you prefer a refund, you will receive the net amount
                        <strong>after deduction of payment gateway charges or any other
                            charges.</strong>
